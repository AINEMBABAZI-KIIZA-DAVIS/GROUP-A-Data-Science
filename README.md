<h2  align="left" > Introduction  </h2>
<p>Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of global health and well-being, reflecting the overall health status, socio-economic conditions,
and quality of life within a nation. Understanding the different factors that influence it is crucial for policymakers, 
public health initiatives, and sustainable development goals. 
This project leverages a comprehensive dataset encompassing various health, economic, social determinants and demographic indicators to 
conduct a detailed analysis of life expectancy trends and drivers across the globe.
